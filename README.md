# SXNet
================


## A Lightweight C++-Focused Fork of Apache MXNet for Low-Resource Systems

SXNet is a stripped-down, C++-optimized version of Apache MXNet, designed for deployment on low-specification systems. This project aims to provide a simplified, easy-to-use framework for C++-based deep learning tasks.


### Original Source

SXNet is derived from Apache MXNet ([Apache MXNet](https://github.com/apache/mxnet)). 
Please refer to the [original README](https://github.com/apache/mxnet/blob/master/README.md) 
for comprehensive information on MXNet.


### Purpose

SXNet serves as a learning tool and a proof-of-concept for C++-based neural network development. Its primary goals are:


* Simplify MXNet's C++ API for educational purposes
* Optimize performance on low-specification systems
* Provide a minimal, easy-to-understand codebase for learning deep learning concepts


### Key Features

* C++-only focus
* Simplified API
* Reduced dependencies
* Optimized for low-specification systems
